                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>All jewelry repair is performed in-house at Jewelry Designs by our team of model makers, bench jewelers,
                stone setters, and master craftsmen. From a cracked ring to a bent or broken prong, our shop will
                inspect and diagnose the best available options to ensure your jewelry can be worn safely. While
                standard repairs are completed within a week, ask your consultant about our Express Same Day Service if
                that is important to you.</p>

                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>While Jewelry Designs can re-make almost any style from scratch, some antique and precious heirlooms are
                so sentimental that you may consider completely restoring them to their original state. Jewelry
                Restoration is for items that need more than that of routine repair. This challenging and rewarding task
                is preformed in-house by one of our master jewelry artisans.&nbsp;<a title="jewelry restoration"

                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Visit Jewelry Designs for a free jewelry inspection and cleaning. Preforming regular check-ups will help
                to ensure your jewelry is safe to wear. A consultant will check all your stones and prongs are secure
                before cleaning. If you would like them to inspect your items further, they will notify you of potential
                dangers to watch out for or future repairs to consider. This preventative measure is recommended every 3
                to 6 months if possible, to help keep stones from falling out, clasps from loosening, and much more.</p>
